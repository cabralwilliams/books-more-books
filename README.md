  ## Description
  This project allows the user to perform searches of the GoogleBooks API for books about given topics.  If the user is registered and logged in, the user can then save searched books for later action.  Finally, if the user wishes to delete a book from her/his saved books list, she/he is able to do so.

  ## Installation
  
  This application runs as a MERN application, using MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.  To install the application, the user would need to clone the files in this repository and then from the command line in the root of the project run the command 'npm install'.  This will install the necessary files for the application to run.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Once the installation steps mentioned earlier have been completed, from the command line and in the root of the project, the user should enter the command 'npm run develop'.  This will start up both the client and server portions of the application, and the user can create a profile and then start searching for and saving books.  (If the user wants to just use a live version of this application, the user can navigate to the live application through the link provided elsewhere in this file.)

  ## Contributing

  This project was refactored from an earlier in place codebase.  (The refactoring changed the code from running on a RESTful API to running with Apollo Server and the GraphQl API.)  There is unlikely any need for further contributions to the project.
  
  
  ## Tests
  
  The only testing performed during development was console logging to see what data was being passed and how it was being presented.
